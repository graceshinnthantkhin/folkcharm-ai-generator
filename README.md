## üåü Overview

This application streamlines the content creation process for the FolkCharm brand. Instead of just generating simple captions, it empowers users to craft rich, narrative-driven content by guiding an AI with structured storytelling choices.

The user uploads a product photo, selects a brand persona ("The Idealist" or "The Connoisseur"), and chooses from a series of prompts based on the **Dan Harmon Story Circle** concept. The tool then generates a complete, self-contained HTML/CSS widget that can be easily copied and pasted into any website, blog, or e-commerce platform.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Guided Story Creation:** Users build a narrative by selecting a persona and three sequential story prompts (Character, Challenge, Resolution).
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** A mock AI service generates a unique story title and body based on the user's selections.
*   **Live Preview:** Instantly see how the final, fully-styled content widget will appear on a website.
*   **Embeddable Code Output:** Generates a portable, self-contained HTML snippet with inline CSS. This ensures the widget looks perfect on any website without conflicting with existing styles.
*   **Brand-Aligned Design:** The user interface and the output widget are both styled to match the elegant, earthy aesthetic of the main FolkCharm brand.
*   **One-Click Copy:** Easily copy the generated story text for social media or the full HTML code for websites.
